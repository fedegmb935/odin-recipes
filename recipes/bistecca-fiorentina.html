    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Bistecca alla Fiorentina</strong>, or <em>Florentine-style beef steak</em>, is a typical italian dish and its name comes from the city of Florence.</p>
    <p>It looks like a T-bone steak, and it is obtained from the sirloin cut of the calf of the Chianina, an italian breed of white cattle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Well, all you need is a good sirloin cut of a Chianina cattle, 1-1,5 kg in weight and 5 or 6 cm in height, and previously aged in cold rooms for about two weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the cut of meat is at room temperature before cooking</li>
        <li>Heat the barbecue grill</li>
        <li>At first, put the steak close to the coals, so that an aromatic crust is formed thank to the <em>Maillard reaction</em></li>
        <li>Cook the steak for 3 to 5 minutes per side, no longer than that</li>
        <li>Put the steak standing on one side and cook it for 5 to 7</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
